# CFG Checker

*CFG Checker* searches for ambiguities in [context-free grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar). It is only semi-decidable to determine whether an arbitrary context-free grammar is [ambiguous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguous_grammar). The best we can do is generate all derivations in a breadth-first fashion and look for two which produce the same sentential form. So that's exactly what CFG Checker does. If the input grammar is ambiguous, CFG Checker will eventually find a minimal ambiguous sentential form. If the grammar is unambiguous, CFG Checker will either reach this conclusion or loop forever.

## Getting started

Here's how it works. You specify the grammar as a series of production rules:

```cfg
expression = number | sum
sum = expression + expression
```

Then you run CFG Checker on it:

```sh
$ cfg-checker example.cfg
....
Found a sentential form with two different derivations:

  expression + expression + expression

Derivation 1:

  0: expression
  1: sum
  2: expression + expression
  3: expression + sum
  4: expression + expression + expression

Derivation 2:

  0: expression
  1: sum
  2: expression + expression
  3: sum + expression
  4: expression + expression + expression
```

If it doesn't finish within a few seconds, the grammar is probably unambiguous unless you gave it some pathological input.

## Grammar syntax

Each line is a production rule. A production rule specifies that a symbol may be rewritten as one of several alternatives separated by pipes (`|`). An alternative is a (possibly empty) sequence of symbols separated by whitespace. Consider this example:

```cfg
S = a S a | b S b | c
```

This rule says `S` can be rewritten to `a S a`, `b S b`, or `c`.

A symbol can be any non-whitespace string except a pipe (`|`). All of the following are valid symbols: `東京`, `foo`, `=`, `+`, `"`, `(`, `)`, etc.

The first rule in the grammar determines the start symbol.

## How to build and install

Just run `make` from the root of this repository. A binary called `cfg-checker` will be produced. You can run `make install` to install it to `/usr/local/bin`, or `make install PREFIX=/custom/path` to change the installation prefix.

CFG Checker is written in C++ and has no dependencies.
